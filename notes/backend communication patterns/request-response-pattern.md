# Request-Response Pattern in Backend Communication with Go

The **Request-Response** pattern is a foundational concept in backend communication. It is a **synchronous communication model** where a **client sends a request** to a service and **waits for a response**.

here we have the basics of the pattern, implementation in Go, and an advanced use case using **NATS messaging system**.

---

##  What is the Request-Response Pattern?

The Request-Response pattern involves two main roles:

- **Requester**: Sends the request.
- **Responder**: Processes the request and returns a response.

This pattern is widely used in REST APIs, RPC systems, and message-based systems (like NATS or gRPC).

### Key Characteristics:

- **Synchronous** (typically): The client blocks until it receives a response.
- **Coupled Lifecycle**: The requester needs the responder to be online.
- **Timeouts & Error Handling**: Important due to the blocking nature.

## Basic Request-Response with Go and HTTP

Hereâ€™s a simple example using Goâ€™s `net/http` package.

### Server (Responder)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello from the server!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/ping", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

### Client (Requester)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    resp, err := http.Get("http://localhost:8080/ping")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    fmt.Println(string(body))
}
```

##  Advanced: Request-Reply with NATS in Go

[NATS](https://nats.io) is a high-performance messaging system that supports **Request-Reply messaging** for microservice communication.

ðŸ“š Reference: [NATS with Golang: Request-Reply Pattern](https://medium.com/@luke-m/nats-with-golang-request-reply-pattern-f5a3f851f6ed)

### Server (Responder)

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
)

func main() {
    nc, _ := nats.Connect(nats.DefaultURL)
    defer nc.Close()

    nc.Subscribe("service.ping", func(m *nats.Msg) {
        log.Println("Received request:", string(m.Data))
        m.Respond([]byte("pong"))
    })

    select {} // keep the server running
}
```

### Client (Requester)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    nc, _ := nats.Connect(nats.DefaultURL)
    defer nc.Close()

    msg, err := nc.Request("service.ping", []byte("ping"), 2*time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println("Response:", string(msg.Data))
}
```

###  Notes:

- `Request()` automatically generates a unique inbox and waits for a single reply.
- You can add timeouts to handle slow or unresponsive services.

---

##  When to Use Request-Response

 Use it when:

- The client needs a direct reply.
- You are building synchronous services.
- The workload is low to medium latency-sensitive.

 Avoid when:

- You want full decoupling or async processing (consider Pub/Sub or Event-Driven).
- You have high load and donâ€™t need immediate responses.

---

##  Best Practices

- Always set **timeouts**.
- Handle **errors and retries**.
- In message systems, **avoid tight coupling** between services.
- In Go, use **context.Context** to propagate deadlines/cancellation.

---

## Conclusion

The Request-Response pattern is a critical tool in a backend developerâ€™s toolbox. In Go, it is easy to implement with both HTTP and message systems like NATS.

Choose the right communication strategy based on **latency**, **scalability**, and **coupling** needs.
